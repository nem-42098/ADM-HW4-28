###Dataset Description:
In this work,we have used the [Banking Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/bank-customer-segmentation) available on the Kaggle.This dataset consists of 1 Million+ transaction by over 800K customers for a bank in India. The data contains information such as - customer age (DOB), location, gender, account balance at the time of the transaction, transaction details, transaction amount, etc.We have used this for mainly two tasks:

-A Finding Similar Customer using Local Sensitivity Hashing Method which gives us recommendation based on input query.
-A Clustering, to find different types of groups present with some specific characteristics.






The repository contains:

- A **README**.md file

- A **jupyter notebook** named **main.ipynb** with the implementation of the LSH algorithm, clustering and the Algorithmic question (questions 1, 2 and algorithmic).

- A **sh** file, named **CommandLine.sh** containing the code to solve the Command Line question.
