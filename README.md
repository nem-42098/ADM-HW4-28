### Dataset Description:
In this work,we have used the [Banking Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/bank-customer-segmentation) available on the Kaggle.This dataset consists of 1 Million+ transaction by over 800K customers for a bank in India. The data contains information such as - customer age (DOB), location, gender, account balance at the time of the transaction, transaction details, transaction amount, etc.We have used this for mainly two tasks:

1. Finding Similar Customer using Local Sensitivity Hashing Method which gives us recommendation based on input query.
2. Clustering, to find different types of groups present with some specific characteristics.







The repository contains:

- A **README**.md file

- A **jupyter notebook** named **main.ipynb** with the implementation of the LSH algorithm, Clustering with it's analysis,Bonus(partly) and the Algorithmic question.

- A **sh** file, named **CommandLine.sh** containing the code to solve the Command Line question.
